# Editing the Digital Media Log

The [Digital Media Log](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/dm_log) is a Ruby on Rails app that uses ArchivesSpace's API to quickly inventory digital media items and log disk imaging.

There are [several issues](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/dm_log/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Ahackathon) that could potentially be worked on during a virtual hackathon.
