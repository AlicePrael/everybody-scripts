base version, stuff we agree is relatively straightforward

collaborative version: (interactive)
get user input
prompt for rules, if none use default (START WITH DEFAULT NO MATTER WHAT)
csv output default

default rules?
* does every file have an extension? 
* no file is zero bytes?
* no hidden files of any flavor
* no whitespace in filename

sample output
Say we have this set of files---
- word doc.doc (SHOULD FAIL)
- thisisapdfnoext (SHOULD FAIL)
- this is a pdf (SHOULD FAIL)
- .git ignore no ext (0 bytes) (FAILS ALL THE TIME)
- empty_FILE (0 bytes) (SHOULD FAIL)
- totallynormal.pdf (SHOULD PASS)
- Thumbs.db (SHOULD FAIL)
- anothertotallynormal.pdf (SHOULD PASS)

Run through every single test, even if fails once
"Pass All" for passing every single rule, hooray

fullpath,filename,pass_all,rule1,rule2...
./anothertotallynormal.pdf, anothertotallynormal.pdf, TRUE, ...




customization ideas!!
(non-interactive version)
optional
* custom rules
if none specified, use default
mandatory
* directory
more tweaking?
* specify what kind of output? (csv, txt)
script output: 
csv output (or other type of text?)
pipe to bagit.py! (farrell)
prompt / specify excluded extensions
presence of specific file (perhaps even with specific name)
custom headings for output of rules
