# everybody-scripts
hack days for everybody

## what are we working on in 2018?
Collaborative coding! Our goal: To gain experience writing collaboratively writing a simple script that checks a set of files for compliance against a list of criteria. Many of us prepare collections for ingest in various delivery/preservation repositories, and eventually the script should be customizable so we can adapt it for the requirements of our own respective local repositories.
