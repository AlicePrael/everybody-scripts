# how to participate
Would you like some coding help? Here's what you do:
1. Fill out your name, and short description of the task in the table below
2. (Optionally) create a ReadMe.MD file for your task and add it to the repository (ask me if you need help with a pull request!)
3. Ask for participants on the BitCurator mailing list
4. Once you've got your team, set up a series of Zoom meetings to solve all the things!
5. Let us know how it goes!
