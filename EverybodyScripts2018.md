# Proposed Collaborative Project - Jan 2018

*Goal:*

To gain experience writing a simple script that checks a set of files for compliance against a list of criteria and then modify it    according to local needs.

1.  Collaboratively write pseudo-code (ie what needs to happen and the order in which it should happen)
2.  Agree on the language 
3.  Meet once a month and work on code
4.  Once code is written, as homework, everyone takes the code and modifies it to meet a local need
5.  Share results


*General idea*
* Script input: Directory, list of rules
* Script output: Pass or Fail

*Possible rule examples*
* All file ingests must be named after a collection (some pattern of letters and numbers), and must include a subdirectory that is named Documentation. Script ideally would fail if both of these conditions are not met for a target directory.
